# Installation {#install}

`PrAna` can be installed as any other R package, however, since it is dependent on some other software tools some extra steps are required for the installation.



You can install the development version of PrAna from GitHub with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("jkkishore85/PrAna")

```
Note that you will need to have the latest R version installed in order to use this repository.
